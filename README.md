A rogue-like topdown bullethell twinstick shooter<br>
or simply an etg clone 

Couldn't finish it cause adding guns and enemies was too much of a task<br>
I won't ever be writing Java again(I hope at least) so don't wait any updates

Had some cool mechanics so if anyone is reading this I will explain them 

You could reflect the bullets with your shield but the shield was at the opposite end of the gun<br>
you had to move the gun to shield and you got stunned if you got hit

Don't know if the game was any fun cause:<br>
it had no monsters/guns/rooms

Its really sad tbh<br>
being unable to finish any project :/
