A rogue-like topdown bullethell twinstick shooter<br>
or simply an etg clone 

Couldn't finish it cause adding more content would take too much time<br>
I am no longer using Java to make games so don't wait any updates

You can reflect the bullets with your shield but the shield is at the opposite end of the gun<br>
you have to move the gun to shield yourself from attacks and if you manage to block the attack with your shield you'll get stunned<br>
there are a few enemies and a room generating system
